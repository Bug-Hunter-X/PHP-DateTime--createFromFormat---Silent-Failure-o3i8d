# PHP DateTime::createFromFormat() Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when using the `DateTime::createFromFormat()` function. If the format string doesn't match the input date string, the function silently returns `false`, which can be easily overlooked and lead to unexpected errors.

The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for the failure and handles the error gracefully.

This is a crucial issue for robust date and time handling in PHP applications.
